 * Turn a Survey123 share URL into one served through this portal's proxy.
 *
 * Two things have to happen, and neither is optional:
 *
 *  1. The form is framed at FORMS_PROXY_BASE so it is same-origin. Framed at
 *     survey123.arcgis.com it is sealed to us, and although the form ITEM is
 *     public, the feature layer it submits to is not — so ArcGIS Identity
 *     Manager prompts for a sign-in inside the frame.
 *  2. `portalUrl` is REPLACED. Survey123 reads it from its own query string and
 *     addresses the portal with it, so it must point at our portal proxy rather
 *     than straight at gis.rdb.rw; that is what routes the form's portal calls
 *     back through this origin, where the session token is attached. It must be
 *     absolute — a relative value is not accepted.
 *
 * Whatever portalUrl the catalog URL carried is dropped: it names the upstream
 * for a human reading the catalog, and PORTAL_ORIGIN is what actually decides
 * where the proxy points.
 *
 * NOTE: forms only work over https. Survey123 forces https on the portal URL,
 * so under `npm run start:local` (HTTP_ONLY=1) its very first portal calls go
 * to an https port with no listener and the form dies. Use `npm start`, which
 * serves TLS from .certs.
